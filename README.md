# Boatless Oars
Now updated to 1.19.3!
This pack was based on Vanilla Tweaks' pack: "Oarless Boats"
I decided that was a bit too boring, so I made this. Bamboo rafts are raftless in texture but not in optifine model.

Optifine Optional (I'm not sure what it changes but it did it)

Have fun with my cursed pack!
